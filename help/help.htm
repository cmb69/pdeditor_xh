<h1 id="pdeditor_xh">Pdeditor_XH</h1>
<p>Pdeditor_XH facilitates viewing and editing the page data in the back-end of CMSimple_XH. It also provides some diagnostics regarding potential desynchronisation of content and pagedata (what is supposed to never happen in CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.6). It is meant as an alternative to editing the pagedata sections in content.htm manually, so it should be <em>used by experienced users only</em>, who know exactly what they are doing. It is <em>not a tool for unexperienced users</em>! These should manipulate the pagedata via the interfaces provided by the respective plugins only (often a tab above the editor).</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Pdeditor_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 and PHP ≥ 7.1.0. Pdeditor_XH also requires <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH</a> ≥ 1.8; if that is not already installed (see <em>Settings</em>→<em>Info</em>), get the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a>, and install it.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/pdeditor_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole folder <code>pdeditor/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> folder of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subfolder <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Browse to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Pdeditor</code> in the back-end, and check whether all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the Website. Go to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Pdeditor</code>.</p>
<!-- You can change the default settings of Pdeditor_XH under `Config`.  Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.-->
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Pdeditor_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Pdeditor_XH is used exclusively from the back-end. Open it via <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Pdeditor</code> → <code>Pagedata</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmb69/pdeditor_xh/refs/heads/master/help/admin.png" alt="Screenshot of pagedata editor" style="width: 100%"></p>
<p>Directly below the plugin menu you find the attribute selectbox and a button to delete the selected attribute with all its values from the pagedata.</p>
<p>The default attribute is <code>url</code>, which will trigger a check, if the URLs stored in the pagedata correlate to the respective pages in the content. If not, a warning icon will be displayed. Note, that this warning does not necessarily mean that there is an error in the pagedata. It rather points out <em>a possible corruption</em> of the pagedata file, particularly if <em>all</em> pages below any page are marked, as shown in the screenshot above. Actually, the screenshot was made on an intentionally corrupted pagedata file. If you compare the page headings and URLs, you see that the pagedata were shifted one page down. In this case you have to check and repair the pagedata file manually or restore the latest working backup.</p>
<p>After selecting an attribute you can view and edit the values of this attribute of all pages.</p>
